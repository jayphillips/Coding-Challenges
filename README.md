Week 3: 
Write a function that takes an array of strings and prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list ["This", "is", "a", "frame", "print"] gets printed as:

**********
* This        *
* is             *
* a             *
* frame     *
* print       *
**********

Week 5: 
Create a function that takes a String as a parameter.

Return the sum of any integers that are in the string.

Example:

Given "GH2U87A" you would return the value 17.

If there are no numbers in the string return 0.
